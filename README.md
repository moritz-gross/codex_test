# CYK Algorithm Implementation

_This is a side-project I made while studying for my theoretical CS exam._

The **CYK (Cocke-Younger-Kasami) algorithm** is a dynamic programming algorithm used to determine whether a given string can be generated by a context-free grammar in Chomsky Normal Form (CNF).

## Usage

`uv sync` install dependencies

`uv run app.py` run app
